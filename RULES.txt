Rule types and formats (one rule per line in *.rules file)

GENERAL FORM
SampWeight StepWeight RuleType <rule parameters>
-SampWeight = rule weight for purposes of stochastic gradient term sampling
-StepWeight = rule weight for purposes of stochastic gradient step size
-RuleType = type of rule (seed, sentincl, sentexcl, cl, ml)
-<rule parameters> = rest of arguments vary depending on rule type

SEED RULE
1-50-seed-2-0 = assign all occurrences of word 2 to topic 0
1-50-seed-2,7-0 = assign all occurrences of word 2 or 7 to topic 0
1-50-seed-2 7-0 = assign all occurrences of bigram 2 7 to topic 0

SENTINCL RULE
100.0-100.0-sentincl-6-0 = allow topic 0 only if co-sent w/ topic 6

SENTEXCL RULE
1.0-10.0-sentexcl-0-7 = dis-allow co-sent topic 0 and topic 7

CL RULE
1.0-10.0-cl-3-5 = word 3 and word 5 should not be same topic

ML RULE
1.0-10.0-ml-2-4 = word 2 and word 4 should be same topic
