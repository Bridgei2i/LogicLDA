LogicLDA - Topic modeling with First-Order Logic (FOL) domain knowledge

This code implements inference for the LogicLDA model.  LogicLDA
extends Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) by allowing the user to
specify a weighted first-order logic (FOL) knowledge base (KB), as in
Markov Logic Networks (MLN).  The resulting model can be interpreted
as a Produce of Experts (PoE) consisting of standard LDA and MLN
components.  The inferred topics will then be influenced by both
document-word corpus statistics as well as the user-specified logical
KB. This code performs MAP inference via a stochastic gradient descent
scheme.


CURRENT ISSUES 
-sentence *exclusion* runs are much slower - why?

DATASET DIRECTORY FILES

The input and output files obey the a naming convention where all
files consist of the name of the dataset plus a filetype-specific
extesion.  For example, if we were processing a corpus of New York
Times articles, we would supply input files nyt.docs, nyt.vocab, ...
and LogicLDA would give us output files nyt.topics, nyt.topics, and so
on.
