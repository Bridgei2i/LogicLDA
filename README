EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES FOR IJCAI SUBMISSION
-alchemyInfer directory code necessary to run before LogicLDA run
-use bash scripts (runAll.sh and friends) to run cross-folds
-use IJCAI-LOGIC-GRID scripts to analyze obj fcns, do t-tests, etc
-some topics from qualitative analysis still on biostat network


LogicLDA - Topic modeling with First-Order Logic (FOL) domain knowledge

David Andrzejewski (andrzeje@cs.wisc.edu)

This code implements inference for the LogicLDA model.  LogicLDA
extends Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) by allowing the user to
specify a weighted first-order logic (FOL) knowledge base (KB), as in
Markov Logic Networks (MLN).  The resulting model can be interpreted
as a Produce of Experts (PoE) consisting of standard LDA and MLN
components.  The inferred topics will then be influenced by both
document-word corpus statistics as well as the user-specified logical
KB. This code performs MAP inference via a stochastic gradient descent
scheme.


CURRENT ISSUES 
-sentence *exclusion* runs are much slower - why?

DATASET DIRECTORY FILES

By convention, each dataset is assumed to contain these files
(with the same name as the dataset, eg ./nyt/nyt.init)

Input
        .init

        .alpha
        .beta

        .doclist
        .docs
        .vocab
        .words
        .sent

        .rules

Output
        .sample 
        .phi 
        .theta
        .topics
        .logic
